This repository majorly deals with helping the people who intend to use the command prompt but have limited knowledge on it so it just summarises the commands in a batch file and prompts for few inputs from the user so that the real action is done!
so for the first batch file deals with actions on removable disks i.e formatting,checking the disk, file backup and deleting of some files 
the next step will be organising the task scheduler
